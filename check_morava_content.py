Title: Morava K-theory

Morava K-theory is a generalized cohomology theory in algebraic topology, named after mathematician Jack Morava. It is a key component in chromatic homotopy theory.

Morava K-theory, denoted K(n), is a family of cohomology theories parameterized by a prime number p and a positive integer n. Each K(n) is a complex-oriented cohomology theory with a formal group law of height n.

Key properties of Morava K-theory:
1. K(n) has coefficient ring K(n)* = Fp[vn, vn^(-1)], where vn has degree 2(p^n - 1).
2. K(n) is a periodic cohomology theory with period 2(p^n - 1).
3. The formal group law associated to K(n) has height n.
4. K(n) detects the nth chromatic layer of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.

Morava K-theories play a central role in the chromatic approach to stable homotopy theory, which organizes the stable homotopy category into chromatic layers based on the height of formal group laws.

Applications include:
- Computation of stable homotopy groups of spheres
- Understanding of the chromatic filtration
- Classification of formal group laws
- Connections to modular forms and number theory

Morava K-theory is related to other important cohomology theories such as Johnson-Wilson theory E(n) and Morava E-theory E_n.
