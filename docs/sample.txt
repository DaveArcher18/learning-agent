# LearningAgent Project

The LearningAgent is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that uses:

- Qwen-3 4B via Ollama (32k context window)
- FastEmbed + FlagEmbedding for embeddings (BAAI/bge-small-en)
- Qdrant for vector storage (both embedded and Docker modes)
- Exa Search for web fallback

The agent provides:
- Document ingestion for PDFs, markdown, and text files
- Vector search for relevant context
- Long-term memory of conversations
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Web search fallback when local knowledge is insufficient

All data is stored locally in Qdrant, enhancing privacy while maintaining good performance.
