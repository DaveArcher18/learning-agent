# LearningAgent Project Status

## Overview

LearningAgent is a privacy-focused RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to run entirely locally, combining:

- **Qwen-3 4B** via Ollama (for LLM capabilities)
- **FastEmbed + FlagEmbedding** (for embeddings)
- **Qdrant** (for vector storage)
- **Exa Search MCP** (for web search fallback)

The system enables users to build a personal knowledge base, ask questions against it, and automatically search the web when local content is insufficient.

## Completed Work

### Core Functionality

1. **Document Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Support for PDF, Markdown, TXT, JSON, DOCX, PPTX, and HTML files
   - Robust chunking with TokenTextSplitter
   - Vector embedding with FastEmbed
   - Storage in local Qdrant collection

2. **Retrieval System**
   - Hybrid retrieval combining vector similarity and metadata filtering
   - Multi-query expansion for better recall
   - Memory storage of conversation history in vector DB

3. **Web Search Integration**
   - Exa search for web fallback when local retrieval falls short
   - Research command (`:search`) to explore topics and store findings
   - Web results stored in vector DB for future reference

4. **User Interface**
   - Responsive CLI with Rich formatting
   - Command system for ingestion, search, and configuration
   - Support for conversation memory on/off

### Technical Improvements

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated requirements.txt with precise version requirements
   - Added fallback logic for different import paths and API versions
   - Fixed deprecated imports to use the latest langchain-community packages
   - Added compatibility with latest FastEmbed version (0.6.x)

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error detection and user feedback
   - Graceful fallbacks for document loading failures
   - Connection testing for Qdrant in both embedded and Docker modes
   - Robust embedding with multi-version API support

3. **Performance**
   - Optimized embedding operations with FastEmbed
   - Efficient vector storage with Qdrant
   - Configurable chunking parameters for different use cases

## Current Issues and Resolutions

1. ✅ **Deprecated Imports**: Fixed by updating imports to use langchain-community, langchain-core, and langchain-text-splitters
2. ✅ **LLMChain Deprecation**: Replaced with RunnableSequence approach
3. ✅ **Text Splitter Module**: Added proper imports for TokenTextSplitter and CharacterTextSplitter
4. ✅ **Qdrant Setup**: Created robust setup_qdrant.py for collection initialization
5. ✅ **Dependencies**: Updated requirements.txt with all necessary packages 
6. ✅ **FastEmbed Compatibility**: Updated code to work with FastEmbed 0.6.1+ API

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the complete workflow with various document types
   - Verify web search functionality and storage
   - Ensure compatibility across different environments (macOS, Linux, Windows)

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement batch processing for large document sets
   - Add caching for frequent queries
   - Optimize memory usage for embedding operations

3. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add support for more document types (audio, video transcripts)
   - Implement metadata filtering in the CLI
   - Add export/import functionality for knowledge bases
   - Create a simple web UI as an alternative to the CLI

4. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Improve inline code comments for better maintainability

5. **Deployment**
   - Create Docker compose setup for easy deployment
   - Add CI/CD pipeline for testing
   - Implement versioning for knowledge bases

## Usage Guide

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Setup and start
make setup_db      # Create Qdrant collection if missing
make ingest        # Load documents from ./docs into vector DB
make run           # Start the CLI assistant

# Docker commands
make start_qdrant  # Start Qdrant in Docker
make stop_qdrant   # Stop the Qdrant container
```

### Interactive Commands

Once the agent is running:

```
> Type questions to chat with the agent

Commands:
  :exit             quit the application
  :ingest PATH      ingest new docs on the fly
  :search TOPIC     search the web on a topic and store results
  :config           show current RAG params
  :memory on/off    toggle conversation memory
```
