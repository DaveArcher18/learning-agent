    """
    Connects to a Qdrant instance with robust fallback mechanisms.

    Tries to connect to a Qdrant instance running in Docker (host="localhost", port=6333).
    If the Docker connection fails, it falls back to attempting a connection with an
    embedded Qdrant instance (path="./qdrant_data").

    Prints messages to the console indicating whether it connected to Docker Qdrant,
    embedded Qdrant, or if both attempts failed.

    Returns:
        QdrantClient: The QdrantClient object if a connection is successful.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If connection attempts to both Docker and embedded Qdrant instances fail.
