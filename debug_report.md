# Debugging Report: Morava K-theory Retrieval Issue

## Issue Summary

The learning agent is experiencing a retrieval issue when querying about "Morava K-theory". The terminal output shows a `KeyboardInterrupt` during the retrieval process, suggesting that the query was manually interrupted during execution.

## Environment Status

- **Qdrant Database**: Running properly in Docker (container `qdrant_local`)
- **Ollama Service**: Running (`ollama serve` process is active)
- **Learning Agent**: Initializes successfully but encounters issues during retrieval

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the investigation, the issue appears to be related to the connection between the learning agent and Ollama during the retrieval process. The error occurs specifically when:

1. The agent attempts to retrieve information about Morava K-theory
2. The retrieval process gets stuck or takes too long, leading to a manual interruption (KeyboardInterrupt)

The issue is likely caused by one or more of the following factors:

1. **Connection Timeout**: The connection to Ollama might be timing out during complex queries
2. **Missing Error Handling**: The retrieval chain lacks proper timeout handling and error recovery
3. **Insufficient Fallback Mechanisms**: When Ollama connection fails, the fallback mechanisms aren't working properly
4. **Possible Data Issue**: The database might not contain information about Morava K-theory, or the retrieval process is failing to find relevant documents

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Improve Error Handling in Retrieval Service

Update the `RetrievalService` class to include better timeout handling and error recovery:

```python
# In RetrievalService.retrieve_and_answer method
def retrieve_and_answer(self, query: str, messages: List[BaseMessage]) -> str:
    # Add timeout handling for Ollama connection
    try:
        # Set a timeout for the retrieval operation
        with timeout(seconds=30):  # Implement a timeout context manager
            rprint("[cyan]üîç Using RAG to answer query...[/cyan]")
            return self.retrieval_chain.invoke(query)
    except TimeoutError:
        rprint("[yellow]‚ö†Ô∏è Retrieval timed out, falling back to alternatives[/yellow]")
        # Continue to fallbacks
    except Exception as e:
        # Existing error handling
```

### 2. Implement a Robust Fallback Chain

Create a more robust fallback mechanism that tries multiple approaches:

```python
# In RetrievalService class
def retrieve_with_fallbacks(self, query: str, messages: List[BaseMessage]) -> str:
    # Try vector search first
    try:
        if self.vector_store_healthy and self.vector_db.has_documents():
            return self.retrieval_chain.invoke(query)
    except Exception as e:
        rprint(f"[yellow]‚ö†Ô∏è Vector retrieval failed: {e}[/yellow]")
    
    # Try web search if enabled
    if self.web_search_enabled:
        try:
            web_results = self.web_search.search(query)
            if web_results and not web_results.startswith("Error"):
                # Use web results to generate a response
                web_context = {"context": web_results, "question": query}
                return self.web_response_chain.invoke(web_context)
        except Exception as web_e:
            rprint(f"[yellow]‚ö†Ô∏è Web search failed: {web_e}[/yellow]")
    
    # Fall back to direct LLM response
    return self.llm.invoke(messages).content
```

### 3. Add Timeout Handling for Ollama Connections

Implement a timeout context manager to prevent hanging connections:

```python
import signal
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timeout(seconds):
    def signal_handler(signum, frame):
        raise TimeoutError(f"Operation timed out after {seconds} seconds")
    
    # Set the timeout handler
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal_handler)
    signal.alarm(seconds)
    
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        # Disable the alarm
        signal.alarm(0)
```

### 4. Verify Database Content

Check if information about Morava K-theory exists in the database:

```bash
# Run a more detailed audit with search capability
python audit_qdrant.py --search "Morava K-theory" --full
```

If the information is missing, consider adding relevant documents to the database:

```bash
# Add documents about Morava K-theory to the docs directory
mkdir -p docs/mathematics
# Add PDF or text files about Morava K-theory

# Then ingest the documents
python ingest.py --path ./docs
```

### 5. Update LangChain Dependencies

The warning about deprecated `ChatOllama` suggests updating dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-ollama
```

Then update the import in `learning_agent.py`:

```python
# Replace this line
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama

# With this line
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama
```

## Implementation Plan

1. First, implement the timeout handling to prevent hanging connections
2. Update the retrieval service with better error handling and fallbacks
3. Verify database content and add missing information if needed
4. Update dependencies to use the latest LangChain components
5. Add more detailed logging to track the retrieval process

These changes will make the learning agent more robust when handling complex queries and connection issues with Ollama.
